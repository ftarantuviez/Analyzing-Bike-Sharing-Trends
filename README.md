# Analyzing Bike Sharing Trends

### Dataset: [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

## Problem Statement

With environmental issues and health becoming trending topics, usage of bicycles as a mode of
transportation has gained traction in recent years. To encourage bike usage, cities across the world have
successfully rolled out bike sharing programs. Under such schemes, riders can rent bicycles using manual/
automated kiosks spread across the city for defined periods. In most cases, riders can pick up bikes from one
location and return them to any other designated place.
The bike sharing platforms from across the world are hotspots of all sorts of data, ranging from travel
time, start and end location, demographics of riders, and so on. This data along with alternate sources
of information such as weather, traffic, terrain, and so on makes it an attractive proposition for different
research areas.
The Capital Bike Sharing dataset contains information related to one such bike sharing program
underway in Washington DC. Given this augmented (bike sharing details along with weather information)
dataset, can we forecast bike rental demand for this program?
